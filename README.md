# 📄 Python File Modifier

This is a simple Python script that:
- 📥 Reads content from an input file
- ✏️ Modifies the content (by converting it to uppercase)
- 📤 Saves the modified version to a new output file
- ❗Handles common file-related errors like missing files or permission issues

---

## 🛠 How It Works

The script prompts the user to enter:
1. **Input filename** – the file to read.
2. **Output filename** – where the modified content should be saved.

It then:
- Reads the input file’s contents
- Converts all text to **uppercase**
- Writes the modified content to the output file

---

## ▶️ Example

```bash
$ python file_modifier.py
Enter the input filename: notes.txt
Enter the output filename: modified_notes.txt
File successfully processed. Modified content written to modified_notes.txt
```
